ABSTRACT
This paper describes The Arrow Program, a thorough programming assignment suitable for an introductory level course in computer programming. The assignment teaches students how to construct programs modularly from functions and allows them to gain a well-rounded understanding of the three types of control structures: sequential, selection, and repetition. Moreover, the assignment is suitable for implementation in both programming paradigms: procedural (using C/C++) and object-oriented (using Java).
